				<p>Photograph by Barbara Morgan, <em>Morgan Martha Graham, "Letter to the World"</em>(1940), gelatin silver print</p>
				<p>Barbara Morgan was a photographer known for her depictions of modern dancers. My first encounter with her work was in an exhibition including her "light drawings." She remembered how as a child she sat with her father reading each issue of Scientific American. "I vividly remember his telling me that the whole world was made of atoms and that they were all dancing."</p>
